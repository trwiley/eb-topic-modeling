<HR>
@Be careful while walking around outside, especially near the graveyard.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Especially near the graveyard, it's dangerous.<BR>@But now it's been cleaned up, so it's safe, just to let you know.<BR><BR>

<HR>

<HR>
@I'm stronger than a zombie, but a bunch of zombies ganged up on me.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@If you would have taken me along to hunt zombies or something,<BR>@I would have been a big help.<BR><BR>

<HR>

<HR>
@The zombies got me...<BR>@I should have gotten some zombie insurance.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@I'm not afraid of no zombie.<BR>@When they come out, I'll beat them by myself.<BR>@Actually I don't want them to come out.  They're way too scary.<BR><BR>

<HR>
@Yeah, I worked for the zombies,<BR>@but I betrayed them too.  I'm a con man, so I know the score.<BR>@Belch gives life to the zombies, but Belch works for Giygas,<BR>@who I heard might be female.<BR>@Well, I'm not really sure whether Giygas is a male or a female.<BR>@I'm a helpful con man, don't you think?<BR><BR>

<HR>
@I overheard the zombies whisper,<BR>@<Master Belch will give us our lives back.><BR>@...Master Belch is the zombie leader.  He must be really pukey.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@This town has completely changed from the first time you were here.<BR>@Can you feel the love?<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Like I told you, there was a barfy bad guy named Belch.<BR>@Thank you for giving him the big flush.<BR><BR>

<HR>
@That's right, there is a rumor that a monster called Belch is screwing up the town.<BR>@Belch!  That's a gross, twisted name even for a monster!<BR><BR>

@Zombies and ghosts are on the loose here, so I can't get to Twoson or Fourside.<BR>@Maybe the hidden road in the graveyard is safe...<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@If you weren't here, I might have had to be friendly with the zombies!<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@You guys got rid of the zombies,<BR>@'cept the ghosts in the tunnel seem scarier than ever!<BR><BR>

<HR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@I thought there was something more to you than just your smile.<BR><BR>

<HR>
@I saw a beat-up tour bus going to Fourside.  We can't go through the tunnel.<BR>@The band was really noisy, so the ghosts didn't approach the bus.<BR>@It must be great to be so happy-go-lucky, huh!<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@I wanted to catch one of the ghosts in the tunnel and keep it as a pet.<BR>@I'm just teasin'.  I can tease like that now that they're gone.<BR><BR>
